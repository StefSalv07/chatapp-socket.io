steps to achieve implementation of socket.io with chat app
 
 what is web socket
 Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
1. npm i socket.io
2. import 
3. const socket = require("socket.io")(Server AKA PORT details)// this is mandatory to pass as server constructer
4. establish connection with event listener
5. use io.on()// to on the socket evnet
    you can see 2 options connect and connection select connection
6. create a js file for calling the events
7. in index.html the file which is shown on browser 
    write script 
                This line of code is used to include the Socket.IO client-side library in your HTML file.

        Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. 

        Here's what the line does:

        - `<script>`: This is an HTML tag that you use to include JavaScript in your HTML file.
        - `src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"`: This specifies the source of the JavaScript file. In this case, it's loading the `socket.io.js` file from the `/socket.io` path on the server. This path is automatically served by the Socket.IO server-side library.

        So, this line is necessary if you want to use Socket.IO in your client-side JavaScript code.


7.for front end create a main.js file 
    now create a instance as shown below
        const socket = io(pass connection url and a call back funtion )
